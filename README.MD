The request method receive just an callback that will the executed when the request be completed


## Error variable
Sometimes a error can the throwed, then you can handle it in the err variable, you must check if it is null everytime that you made a request.

## Result variable
The result is the variable that is filled when the request was made with sucess, and your structure is:

- headers : Contain the headers of response
- status : Status code of the operation
- text : The text returned from server

- HEADERS - Define the headers in request configuration, only accepts Json Object

- URL - The server url that will make the connection

- URL_DATA - This is a macro, more used in GET requests, the object will be trasformed in URL params like "?name=Rose&age=17", only accepts Json Objects.

- DATA - The data that will me sent to the target server, only accept Json Object

- Err - Variable that holds some request error

- Result - Variable that holds request results

## Exceptions
Some library's execeptions can be throwed when you make bad use of the library, they are:

- notObjectReceivedException - When you don't passed an Json Object as constructor configuration

- headersWasNotObject - When you don't passed an Json Object to headers configuration

- targetUrlWasNotAnString - When you don't passed an String to URL configuration

- dataArgumentWasNotJsonObject - When you don't passed an Json Object to data configuration

- urlDataArgumentWasNotJsonObject - When you don't passed an Json Object to url data configuration

- dataArgumentInGetRequest - When you try GET request after put some data configuration in the constructor
